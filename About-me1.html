            <h2>Person Interests</h2>
            <p>I am an artist, I have been drawing ever since I could remember. My main art medias are pencil,
                digital, and now painting. I don't have as much time for it, at least not as much as I used to.
                I still try and keep up with it by sketching when I can. I entered into a few contests in high 
                school when prompted to by my teachers, but never won anything. Which is fine by me, I do art 
                because I like it and not for any other reasons. I do still get to paint because of my job, but 
                it's mostly paitning walls and doing touch ups. 
            </p>
            <p>I like to play video games. I don't plan on going into game design however. I just enjoy the stories
                and the interaction that I get from video games. Once again haven't had as much time as I once did 
                to play them but I still play a few with my friends when I can. ONe of my close friends is an electrical
                engineering major and it very into a game called satisfactory. He got me into it and now we play together
                since he now lives in south Utah.
            </p>
            <p>I am a big reader. If I have free time I am doing one of three things, reading, playing games, doing art.
                Reading is a bit easier to do anywhere though so I definetly read more than I play games or make art. I am
                not very into non-fiction but do enjoy reading academic articles on occasion. Most of the time though I'm 
                enjoying a science fiction or fantasy book. I am particularly found of post apocoliptic books for some reason 
                and have read a lot of vartions of the apocolypse because of that.
